The attached file is the sqlite-version of the reporting app. 

To generate a new report, the necessary steps are: 
1. In admin, create Event data
2. In admin, create two SatImage data (selecting the event related)
3. In admin, create (affected) Area data  (selecting the event related)
4. Go to the homepage and click "New Informe"
5. Fill in the fields and save

From now on, I will concentrated on Index management system,  
as it is rather difficult to switch back and forth between two apps.
